# EspHome RC Car Camera Robot FPV
## Version 1.0

 - Control a Camera wherever you want in your House with this RC Car Camera. 
 - You can control away from home like everything in HA.
 - In my case the camera have a lot of lag, must to have patience to move where you want.

I am not an electronics, programming or espHome expert. I have been searching, getting inspiration from videos and looking for information until I put the pieces together. What I am is a big fan of Home Assistant with a multitude of home automation devices, even addicted :).

(I've tried it later with an esp32cam but I can't get it to work, I'll put it aside later in the same battery).

 EVERYTHING IS QUITE PROVISIONAL, I DON'T HAVE IMAGE DIAGRAM YET and has not been assembled yet, when I have all the pieces I will soldering and update this page 

QUESTIONS:

 - How to know the battery status?
 - How to connect 2 or more led lights to same pin with transistors and ohms?

MATERIALS:

 - Esp8266 nodemcu board
 - Eap32 cam board
 - 12V Battery, works when it's charging so it's possible to move the camera. 12V 6800mah 18650 6.8Ah Li-ion Rechargeable Battery with Protection Board 
 - 12.6V Charger
https://a.aliexpress.com/_vECinm
 - Arduino Car Kit with 4 TT motors and wheels
https://a.aliexpress.com/_ugpMKk
 - Servo Pan Tilt it depends on the weight of the camera:
 - Servo PT Pan/Tilt for 2 servo motors sg90 or mg90s 360ยบ, in my case the sg90 sometimes it doesn't have enough strength to move up a Xiaofang Camera
https://a.aliexpress.com/_vaiPQg 

Or
 -  MG996 Pan/Tilt for 2 servo motors MG996 
https://a.aliexpress.com/_v7d13E
 - 2 servo motors  SG90 or Mg90 360ยบ

Or
 - 2 servo motors MG996 360ยบ
https://a.aliexpress.com/_vYO1g4
 - Dupont Cables
 https://a.aliexpress.com/_vOOCXW
 - USB Voltage Regulator DC-DC Charger or a Portable Battery for the usb camera
https://a.aliexpress.com/_vLq7TC
 - rtsp USB Camera (Xiaomi Xiaofang in my case) because I want a better image quality and night vision
 - 12.6 Battery indicator

OPTIONAL: 

  - Soldering PCB boards
https://a.aliexpress.com/_vnVAiM
  - Led lights

FILE CONFIGURATION:

 - Plug your esp8266 in your computer or Raspberry Pi. Select new device in EspHome and choose nodemcuv2 board. Give a name like RC-Car
 - Copy and paste the RC-Car.yaml file, change your ssid and WiFi password validate it and upload it. 
 - Then several entities should appears at Home Assistant:
     - switch.input1
     - switch.input2
     - switch.input3
     - switch.input4
     - light.car_speed
     - light.led_cam
     - service: esphome.rc_car_control_servo_x
     - service: esphome.rc_car_control_servo_y 
 - You have to create two input numbers in helpers from min -100 and max 100 with slider, like this names:
     - input_number.servo_x
     - input_number.servo_y
 - Once created this input_numbers them copy and paste the content of automations.yaml in your automation.yaml or take it as an example and create it in the UI settings
 - Also copy and paste the content of scripts.yaml into your scripts.yaml file or take it as an example and create it in the UI settings
 - In your Home Assistant Lovelace or Dashboard:
     - Create a Camera Live Card 
     - Create a Grid card with all buttons (example if you want to paste in code)
     - Create a Speed Controller using light.speed_control entity with slider 
     - Create a entities card with input_number.servo_x and input_number.servo_y
     - Create a Camera auto Card
 - Plug your esp32cam in your computer or Raspberry Pi. Select new device in EspHome and choose esp32 board. Give a name like RC-Car-32camera
 - Thats It! Have a good time!

TO DO OR WISHLIST:

- It con use only a esp32camera without the esp8266 board.
- Add 1 or 3 more front lights, maybe also 4 backlights using ohms and transistors
- Fix the way the sensor battery know the correct pins or correct code
- 3d printed battery docker station "like a robot vacuum"
