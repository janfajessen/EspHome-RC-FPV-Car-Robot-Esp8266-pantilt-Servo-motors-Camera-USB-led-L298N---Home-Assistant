I am not an electronics, programming or espHome expert. I have been searching and getting inspiration from videos. What I am is a big fan of Home Assistant with a multitude of home automation devices, even addicted :).

I do a RC FPV Car with espHome in a nodemcuv2 8266 board.
 
Pros:
  - Go around the house 
  - Gossip and annoy my dog

Cons:
 - Lot of lag camera and buttons
 - Very Fast Car
 - Many car crashes

(I've tried it later with an esp32cam but I can't get it to work, I'll put it aside later in the same battery).

 EVERYTHING IS QUITE PROVISIONAL, NO IMAGE DIAGRAM and has not been assembled just for testing, VERSION 0.1
  Now it's difficult to control away from home, the camera and the button presses have a lot of lag and instead the car goes very fast. Maybe is my internet connection. 

QUESTIONS:

 - Can someone tell me how to control the speed?
 - How to know the battery status?
